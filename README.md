
While there are a lot of Mexican sandwiches, we chose to give you the Cemita sandwich recipe, one of the best bollito of Central America.

The Cemita Poblana is a sandwich from the region and city of Puebla, in the south of Mexico City. The name derives from the name of the bread itself, a soft brioche roll covered with sesame. 

The sandwich is usually composed of a fried meat cutlet (veal, beef, pork or chicken), topped with a lot of avocados, shredded cheese, a spicy chili sauce and an herb called p√°palo.

Numerous versions of the Cemita exist nowadays, and we are giving you one here with an additional Chorizo and Beans paste.
