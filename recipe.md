
The Cemita Sandwich Recipe
Slice the bread in half, horizontally co cut it open.

Season the Breadcrumbs with salt and pepper to taste, mix well. Season the eggs with salt and black pepper to taste, beat together. Put the chicken in flour, coat well, then soak the chicken pieces in the egg mixture, and finally transfer them to the breadcrumbs mixture. Make sure they are well covered with the breadcrumbs.
In a pan, heat up some oil, and pan-fry the cutlets until golden brown on each sides. The time will depend on the meat you choose. Remove and drain on paper towels.

In a skillet, on high heat, add in the chorizo, break it down with a spoon, and cook for about 5 minutes or until browned and cooked. Then add in the beans, and a bit of water, cook until the beans are warm. Finally mash the chorizo and beans to a paste, add salt if needed. Set aside.

Finally spread some of the bean mixture over one half of the Bolillo, top with the  cutlet, the avocado in thick slices, the onion in thin rings, the chipotle thinly cuts with a bit of its sauce, the cheese (a lot) and some fresh PÃ¡palo herb.
